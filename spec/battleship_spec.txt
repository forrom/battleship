BATTLESHIP!!!

x place and sink ship
x vertical ship
x ships cannot overlap
x ships cannot cross over board's edge
- multiple ships sinking
x different ship lengths
x all ships sunk on board
- board printing

- game flow
	- start game
	- placing ships
	- alternating shots
	- over when one board is cleaned



I.  PLACE AND SINK SHIP
----------------------------
1. Ship can be sunk
	1. Init 10x10 board
	2. Place carrier size 5 at 2,3 horizontally
	3. Shoot
		3.a [2,3]
		3.b [3,3]
		3.c [4,3]
		3.d [5,3]
		3.e [6,3]
	4. Verify that carrier is sunk

2. Ship is not sunk until all segments are hit
	1. Init 10x10 board
	2. Place carrier size 5 at 2,3 horizontally
	3. Shoot
		3.a [2,3]
		3.b [3,3]
		3.c [4,3]
		3.d [5,3]
	4. Verify that carrier is not sunk

3. Ship not sunk if only one segment hit
	1. Init 10x10 board
	2. Place carrier size 5 at 2,3 horizontally
	3. Shoot
		3.a [6,3]
	4. Verify that carrier is not sunk

4. Ships can be placed
	1. Init 10x10 board
	2. Place carrier size 5 at 2,3 horizontally
	3. Verify that ship is placed

5. Second ship can be sunk
	1. Init 10x10 board
	2. Place carrier size 5 at 0,0 horizontally -> verify ship is placed
	3. Place carrier size 5 at 0,3 horizontally -> verify ship is placed
	4. Shoot
		4.a [0,3] -> verify ship2 not sunk
		4.b [1,3] -> verify ship2 not sunk
		4.c [2,3] -> verify ship2 not sunk
		4.d [3,3] -> verify ship2 not sunk
		4.e [4,3] -> verify ship2 sunk

II. VERTICAL SHIP
----------------------------
1. Ship can be placed vertically then sunk	
	1. Init 10x10 board
	2. Place carrier size 5 at 2,3 vertically
	3. Shoot
		3.a [2,3] -> verify not sunk
		3.b [2,4] -> verify not sunk
		3.c [2,5] -> verify not sunk
		3.d [2,6] -> verify not sunk
		3.e [2,7] -> verify sunk

III. OVERLAPPING SHIPS
----------------------------
1. Ships cannot be placed if first ship already occupies at least planned square
	1. Init 10x10 board
	2. Place carrier size 5 at 0,3 horizontally -> verify ship is placed
	3. Place carrier size 5 at 2,3 vertically -> verify ship is not placed


2. Ships cannot be placed if second ship already occupies at least planned square
	1. Init 10x10 board
	2. Place carrier size 5 at 0,0 horizontally -> verify ship is placed
	3. Place carrier size 5 at 0,3 horizontally -> verify ship is placed
	4. Place carrier size 5 at 2,3 vertically -> verify ship is not placed

IV. BOARD EDGES
----------------------------
1. Ship cannot be placed if segment is outside board horizontally
	1. Init 10x10 board
	2. Place carrier size 5 at 6,0 horizontally -> verify ship is not placed

2. Ship cannot be placed if start is outside board vertically
	1. Init 10x10 board
	2. Place carrier size 5 at 0,6 vertically -> verify ship is not placed

3. Ship cannot have negative coordinates
	1. Init 10x10 board
	2. Place carrier size 5 at -1,3 vertically -> verify ship is not placed

V. SHIP SIZES
----------------------------
1. Ship can be placed next to destroyer
	1. Init 10x10 board
	2. Place destroyer at 0,0 horizontally -> verify ship is placed
	3. Place submarine at 2,0 horizontally -> verify ship is placed

2. Ship cannot be placed on destroyer
	1. Init 10x10 board
	2. Place destroyer at 0,0 horizontally -> verify ship is placed
	3. Place submarine at 1,0 horizontally -> verify ship is not placed
